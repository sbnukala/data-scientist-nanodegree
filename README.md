Projects and assignments for data-scientist-nanodegree
This nanodegree is an advanced program with emphasis on Machine Learning for Term 1 and advanced data science for Term 2. 
Term 1 consists of the following projects and concepts
1) Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression, SVM, Ensembling (Random Forest and AdaBoost),  Naive Bayes. Project on Kaggle's Charity ML 
2) Deep Learning: Very different from my deep-learning nanodegree. Although concepts are similar, emphasis is on a project for image classification using PyTorch
3) Unsupervised Learning: Dimensionality Reduciton. PCA. K-Means clustering. Project on clustering customer segments for Aravato's Financial data. 

Term 2 consists of 
1) Writing an end to end blog post for data science
2) Software Engineering for Data Scientists
3) Recommendation Engines for IBM
4) Capstone project
