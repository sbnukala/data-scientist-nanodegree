    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "I have choosen the following 3 supervised learning models: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Random Forests: It's real world application can be in industries that study the behaviour of users, for e.g. in an e-commerce system, it can be used for recommending products based on a person's likes and dislikes. Furthermore it can be applied to finance/banking where the customer's engagement in using the financial services can be predicted. \n",
    "Strengths: Since it is a bagging model, if there are a lot of features, it can essentially spawn multiple learners that focus on different combinations of features and can be \"combined\" into one strong model. The major outcome of this is that Random Forests can reduce variance which can combat overfitting. Furthermore, they can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It can assign relative importance to various features very easily and also requires fewer hyperparameters to tune potentially. \n",
    "Weakness: They can be slow to predict while being fast to train. This can impact a system where there is emphasis on  run time performance (on how fast they can infer a given input). Hence they potentially won't be a great choice when real time prediction is quite important.  Because they need a lot of trees for one model, their memory size can be quite huge.\n",
    "Since the dataset here is medium sized and also has a lot of features, I chose this algorithm with the sheer intention of minimal hyperparameter tuning required while combatting potential overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) AdaBoost: It can be applied to the concept of facial detection.\n",
    "Strengths: Since it is a boosting algorithm, it can essentially train multiple weak learners and output a strong learner by iteratively increasing the weightages of misclassified data points. \n",
    "Weakness: Potentially can contribute to overfitting if the dataset size is very small and can be very sensitive to noisy data or outliers. \n",
    "I chose this one again as it is known to combat overfitting (because the dataset is not too small, it potentially may not contribute to overfitting). Also the number of parameters to tune might potentially be less as well as there were some good preprocessing steps done above to give me confidence that there may not be a lot of outliers that can lead to unwanted results with this algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) SVM (SVC): Support Vector machines are a great way to come up with non linear decision boundaries. They tend to be very good for problems which involve many dimensions for the features. Their real world applications include in the domains of facial recognition, text classification (text is a domain where the number of dimensions can be very high, so it can be easily tackled by SVM). Their strength rely in the fact that they are faster to train and have a lesser bound on time-complexity as opposed to Logistic regression. This is because they only need a subset of the points to maximize the margin between two classes that are being considered to classify against. However, choosing the right kernel and other hyperparameters are extremely important for SVM for different data domains, meaning the possibility of them giving drastically different results for different hyperparameters is higher. Also, they take longer to train on larger datasets. \n",
    "I chose this particular algorithm as there are 13 dimensions invovled in the dataset, and also we tackled outliers in the preprocessing steps, a known limitation of SVM (they are not too good on noisy data)\n",

    "From the graphs above, it is evident that the AdaBoostClassifier is the most appropriate to use on the given dataset. This is because a) It's training and testing time is minimal as opposed to the SVC trainer. b) It outperforms in terms of accuracy on the testing dataset, something that it has never seen before. This indicates that it can combat overfitting or underfitting well as it doesn't suffer from too much variance and bias. c) Although the Random Forest classifier has a better F1 score on the training dataset, it is evident from the testing dataset results that the AdaBoost classifier has better F1 score on it. This indicates that the Random Forest classifier might be overfitting with such high F1 scores on training datasets but not testing datasets. This metric is important as it indicates the harmonic mean between Precision and recall i.e. it indicates a good balance on how the model is performing for false positives and false negatives in a binary classification problem like the one given above. Another good metric to evaluate would be the confusion matrix in a problem like this. "

    "AdaBoost is an algorithm that comes under the ensemble family. The gist of ensemble learning is taking a diverse set of learners (weak learners) and combining to come up with a strong learner. This technique in reality can be better than random guess. \n",
    "The way Adaboost works is that it gets passed a base estimator that gets trained on and the points that are classified well and misclassified are captured. Then, another learner is trained that focusses more on the misclassfied points by the first model. This process continues iteratively where on each iteration more emphasis (weightage) is given to the misclassified points. Eventually the weighted mean of all models is taken for a prediction where the probabilty of misclassification is reduced as a result of the iterative traning of multiple weak learners. \n",
    "\n",
    "For e.g. let's say a student has taken a course XYZ, turns out there are 10 practice quizzes with each quiz spans across 10 different lessons. i.e. 1 quiz has questions from all 10 lessons.  After the first quiz, the student has an idea on what lessons he is able to answer well on vs what lessons he needs improvement on. This is the analogous to the base model. On the second test, the student focusses to study more on lessons he didn't do well on and takes the test and this process continues. Eventually the student has a grasp on most of the lessons and can perform better on the final test. The catch here is, he puts emphasis on topics that he didn't perform well after each test and that is where the weightage in an AdaBoost classifier comes into picture. \n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
